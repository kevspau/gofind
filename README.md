# gofind
### a tiny little package manager i made for fun, W.I.P

this is just a fork of [my other account's repo](https://github.com/sharpcdf/gofind), however this is the only one that will be updated.

# Usage

This package manager can be used in the following ways:

On the command line,

`gof find [github repo url]` (`gof help` for more info)

This downloads the repo, unpacks it into a folder, and places the folder in the current working directory.

Or with the api,

N/A

This will allow you to easily download github files through the gofind api

# Why?

I was bored, and thought that it would be fun to implement http(s) requests with file manipulating. Yes, there are also winget, curl, and other url downloaders/package managers that provide compatibility with other websites, but gofind's goal is to provide a simplified way to download exclusively GitHub and other Git based websites' repositories, either for editing for pull requests, or for forking repos. Eventually, I plan to make an all-out package system where you can publish your own packages by using a custom file extension for organization.
